# Dodag-Detection
The objective of this project is to detect attacks targeting DODAG (Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph) networks, which are commonly used in low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). The focus will be on identifying various types of attacks, such as rank attacks, route attack, and resource depletion attacks, using machine learning techniques.
